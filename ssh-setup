This is already not correct, use this 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
and ssh add similar to below

To generate a new key use:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "tom.flaherty03@gmail.com"
           [type] [bytes] [your email]

Let it save in the default folder (just press enter when it asks)

If you are sure that no-one else will get your key, then you can get away 
with not setting a passphrase
But if you use a passphrase, some automated things might not work properly

Anyway! Add the ssh key to your computer using:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
This might need a pub on the end

To view your ssh key (you'll need to get it into your clipboard):
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Don't forget the pub

And add the ssh key to git:
https://github.com/settings/keys

Title it with the name of the device you created the ssh key on
