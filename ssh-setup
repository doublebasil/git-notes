Create the key:
           ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
You need a passphrase for github

Add the key to your pc:
           ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
           
           If ssh-add says "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent"
           then you may need to start the ssh agent using:
           eval `ssh-agent -s`

Add the key to github:
Copy the output of the following
           cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
And add it as a new ssh key here
github.com/settings/keys
